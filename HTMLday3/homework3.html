      <b>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of</b>
      <br>
      <b>humans or animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines</b>
      <br>
      <b>"AI" may also refer to the machines themselves.</b>
      <br>
      <b>AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government and science. Some high-profile applications</b>
      <br>
      <b>are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube,</b>
      <br>
      <b>Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo)</b>
      <br>
      <b>generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategy games (such</b>
      <br>
      <b>as chess and Go)</b>
      <br>
      <b>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[2] The field went through multiple cycles</b>
      <br>
      <b>of optimism[3][4] followed by disappointment and loss of funding,[5][6] but after 2012, when deep learning</b>
      <br>
      <b>surpassed all previous AI techniques,[7] there was a vast increase in funding and interest</b>
      <br>
      <b>The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The</b>
      <br>
      <b>traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural</b>
      <br>
      <b>language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an</b>
      <br>
      <b>arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[8] To solve these problems, AI researchers have</b>
      <br>
      <b>adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical</b>
      <br>
      <b>optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research</b>
      <br>
      <b>and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and many other fields</b>
