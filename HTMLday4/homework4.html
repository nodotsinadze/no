  <p>The English word "Christmas" is a shortened form of "Christ's Mass".</p>
  <p> The word is recorded as Crīstesmæsse in 1038 and Cristes-messe in 1131.</p>
  <p>Crīst (genitive Crīstes) is from Greek Khrīstos (Χριστός), a translation of Hebrew Māšîaḥ "Messiah", meaning "anointed"</p>
  <P>and mæsse is from Latin missa, the celebration of the Eucharist.</P>
